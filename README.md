# Lead-Scoring-Case-Study-Upgrad
Problem Statement

 An education company named X Education sells online courses to industry professionals.
On any given day, many professionals who are interested in the courses land on their website and browse for courses. They have process of form filling on their website after which the company that individual as a lead.
Once these leads are acquired, employees from the sales team start making calls, writing emails, etc.Through this process, some of the leads get converted while most do not. 
The typical lead conversion rate at X education is around 30%. Now, this means if, say, they acquire 100 leads in a day, only about 30 of them are converted. To make this process more efficient, 
the company wishes to identify the most potential leads, also known as Hot Leads.If they successfully identify this set of leads, the lead conversion rate should go up as the sales 
team will now be focusing more on communicating with the potential leads rather than making calls to everyone


Data:

You have been provided with a leads dataset from the past with around 9000 data points. This dataset consists of various attributes such as Lead Source, Total Time Spent on Website, Total Visits, Last Activity, etc. which may or may not be useful in ultimately deciding whether a lead will be converted or not. The target variable, in this case, is the column ‘Converted’ which tells whether a past lead was converted or not wherein 1 means it was converted and 0 means it wasn’t converted. You can learn more about the dataset from the data dictionary provided in the zip folder at the end of the page. Another thing that you also need to check out for are the levels present in the categorical variables. Many of the categorical variables have a level called 'Select' which needs to be handled because it is as good as a null value (think why?).

Business Objective

Lead X wants us to build a model to give every lead a lead score between 0 -100 . So that they can identify the Hot leads and increase their conversion rate as well. 
The CEO want to achieve a lead conversion rate of 80%.
They want the model to be able to handle future constraints as well like Peak time actions required, how to utilize full man power and after achieving target what should be the approaches.

Results Expected

A well-commented Jupyter note with at least the logistic regression model, the conversion predictions and evaluation metrics.
